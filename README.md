# Colorectal cancer detection using Deep Learning techniques

The aim is quite simple. We have to build different algorithms that detect whether a patient has
or whether they may develop colon cancer in future. Based on current screening techniques like
electron microscopic imaging and endoscopy respectively.
Further we will work more on genomic data or any other ways to improve our ideation even
better. Also try to put all these algorithm into one app using flask library in python.
These are the steps that I followed to ensure how potent colon cancer is...
What are the specific characteristics so on..

## 1) why are we taking Colorectal cancer among other cancer and how potent it is...
https://github.com/ShaamNatheshwar/capstone/blob/master/1_cancerDeathRate.ipynb
from the above dataset the death casualty is high in India recently...Also Colorectal cancer is the
second most prominent from the above data structure.
Methodology used for the above dataset..
ML plotting algorithm for graphs like pyplot plotly and seaborn to classify and plot
## 2) comparative studies among male and female in different countries
https://github.com/ShaamNatheshwar/capstone/blob/master/MaleFemaleAnalysis.ipynb
From the above dataset females are affected more than male...especially Chinese.
Methodology
ML algorithms - numpy, pandas to access the data
ML plotting algorithm - seaborn and plotly

## 3) How to find whether we have colorectal cancer on the basis of endoscopy and microscopy
images

https://github.com/ShaamNatheshwar/capstone/blob/master/3_HighAccuracyCNN.ipynb
https://github.com/ShaamNatheshwar/capstone/blob/master/4_endoscopy.ipynb
We used our own model by classifying given datasets into test train val respectively.Where the
entire datasets was divided into train - 70, val - 15, test - 15. An algorithm was built using CNN a
deep learning algorithm. Results with accuracy of 81-90 was obtained
Deep learning algorithms - Convolutional Neural Network is used (CNN)
## 4) How to find the presence of colorectal cancer using genomic data
As of now we are just working on to it

## 5) Further preceding
We have planned to build a web application where we can upload either endoscopy image or
electronmicroscopy image or genomic data . And verify our whether we are having colon cancer
or whether we may develop it later
